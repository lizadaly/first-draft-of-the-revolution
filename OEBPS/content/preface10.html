          <p>Henri reads this, then reads its enclosure. The August sunlight comes through the window and lights up both pages with hot and glaring light, as though the words were going to catch fire.</p>
    
    <p>It is an old trick to link two pages together, tightly, so that the meanings of the texts blend together. It conceals the meaning written there, and ordinarily can be untangled only by another magic user. The friar must write to someone who has magical ability.</p> 
    
    <p>Henri spreads the paper on his desk and scowls at it. Is it possible to take apart the meaning by hand?</p>
    
    <p>The shape of the words is like poetry, the lines doubled like a psalm. Henri tries one psalm after another against the original text. It takes patience and the most delicate magic to separate the layer that is King David's from the layer written by the friar.</p>
